We seek doctors in Statistics (or related areas) with strong research
potential that can develop supervised work on the aforementioned topics.
It is desirable that the candidates have proven experience in data
analysis and computer skills. The selected researchers will work in São
Paulo or Campinas under the supervision of one the project’s principal
investigators.

Interested candidates should apply to
[*stodad@ime.unicamp.br*](mailto:stodad@ime.unicamp.br). The application
email should contain the following:

(i) A letter (pdf file) explaining the candidate’s background, in which
    topic(s) they’d like to work and the reasons why they feel they are
    suitable for the proposed task.

(ii) Candidate’s CV (pdf file).

(iii) PhD dissertation summary (pdf file) and a two-page summary of
    published works (pdf file).

(iv) E-mail and postal (official university or professional) addresses
    for two former research supervisors or course professors which are
    willing to write recommendation letters.
